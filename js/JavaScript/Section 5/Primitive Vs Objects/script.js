/*

The concept of passing variables in javasctript is a bit complicated. Both primitives and 
objects are passed by value.
However, the value for objects is a reference to that object in memory.

a) When you pass a primitive to a function, a new independent copy is passed that's why the original value is not changed 
b) When you pass an object to a function, a copy of reference to that object is passed that's why the original value is overriden
