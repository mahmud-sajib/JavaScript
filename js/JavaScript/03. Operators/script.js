/*

1. Operator precedence determines the way in which operators are parsed with respect to each other. Operators with higher precedence execute first and operators with lower precedence executes later.

2. Pre and Post increment:
    a) With ++i, the value is first incremented, then evaluated. So if i was 1, it would be counted as 2,and
    then stored as 2. 

    b) With i++, the value is first evaluated, then incremented. So if i was 1, it would be counted as 1, but then stored as 2.
